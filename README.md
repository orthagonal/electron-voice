# electron-voice

## A fast, complete speech-to-text interface for Electron 

- works with any [Vosk model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) 
- runs the audio device in a dedicated process separate from Electron browser, so it is very fast and not subject to any browser security limitations
- sends identified speech back to Electron using the Neon bridge
- can do generalized speech recognition
- can take in a custom grammar to limit the recognized words


You can install the project with npm. In the project directory, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building vosk-electron

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./index.node`.


## electron_main.js Example

```js

// import the module just like any other node dependency
const voiceModule = require('index.node');  

// define a handler that gets called any time new words are identified
function onWordsFound(words) {
  console.log(words);
}
// resets the recognizer to prevent it from getting bogged down
const MAX_WORDS = 25;

// get list of devices
const devices = voiceModule.listDevices();
// select a device from the list:
voiceModule.setMicName(devices[2]);
// download models from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
voiceModule.setPathToModel('vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15');
// you can specify a grammar to limit the recognized words and
// improve accuracy, this step is optional
voiceModule.setGrammar('["hello", "world"]');
voiceModule.startListener(trackWordsFound, MAX_WORDS); 
// wait for the model to load, the big ones can take a few minutes:    
let interval;
interval = setInterval(() => {
  if (voiceModule.isModelLoaded()) {
    console.log('speech model loaded!');
    mainWindow.webContents.send('modelReady', true);
    clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, 1000);
```



### index.node

The Node addon—i.e., a binary Node module—generated by building the project. This is the main module for this package, as dictated by the `"main"` key in `package.json`.

Under the hood, a [Node addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) is a [dynamically-linked shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries). The `"build"` script produces this file by copying it from within the `target/` directory, which is where the Rust build produces the shared object.
